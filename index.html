                <p>Previously, discussion of builds in ROR2 was rather limited due to players having limited input on
                    what items they got, but with the introduction of the Command artifact, many players are finding
                    themselves asking a simple question: "How do I build damage?"
                </p>
                <p>The concept of damage packages is that they combine items that synergize underneath into one
                    convenient, uh, package, so that instead of having each build having to list all the relevant damage
                    items, they can just refer to the relevant package(s). These are, as you may expect, based on my
                    experience and opinions. I consider Equipment to be part of your "build", rather than a fragment of
                    it, so I won't be covering it in this guide.

                                some fun. NOTE: this only requires you to be sprinting, not moving. If you sprint into a
                                wall, you can have both Little Disciple and Bustling Fungus active at the same time.

                            <td class='align-middle'>Shaped Glass is the king of Risk of Rain 2. Each stack doubles your
                                damage and halves your health, and they stack multiplicatively, meaning 2 gives 4x
                                damage, 3 gives 8x, 4 gives 16x, etc. When playing casually, these are never needed, but
                                if you're actually trying, you should grab as many as you can handle.
